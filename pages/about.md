      <a id="about-top"></a>
      **echo-IA** (Enabling Cosmology with Homogenized Observations of Intrinsic Alignments) is a community space
      for _intrinsic alignment_ research. We bring together catalogs, tools, datasets, and workflows so results are
      easier to compare, reproduce, and extend.

      Our goal is practical interoperability: lightweight standards, clear provenance, and shared building blocks — so teams can
      plug in their data or code and get to science faster. When licensing allows, we also **host or mirror on Zenodo**
      under an echo-IA collection, always linking back to original sources.

      - **Catalogs:** curated, public galaxy-shape catalogs with comparable metadata  
      - **Tools:** analysis libraries, pipelines, diagnostics, and plotting utilities  
      - **Workflows:** reproducible paths from inputs to posteriors (configs, CI, examples)  
      - **Standards:** minimal schemas for fields, units, and metadata; recommended citations  
      - **Community:** meetings, workshops, and issue trackers for coordination

      echo-IA is a collaboration across multiple cosmology communities, including LSST DESC,
      DESI, DES, Euclid, and NASA Roman. It operates as an open coordination space for researchers studying
      intrinsic alignments and related systematics in weak lensing and large-scale structure.

      The initiative was founded by [Jonathan Blazek](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/jonathan-blazek/) and
      [Benjamin Joachimi](http://www.star.ucl.ac.uk/~joachimi/), who continue to provide scientific
      leadership and community guidance.

      [Elisa Chisari](https://echisari.wordpress.com) provides additional guidance and coordination, 
      linking echo-IA with survey collaborations and helping drive interoperability and data-standards work.

      [Niko Šarčević](https://nikosarcevic.com) leads day-to-day coordination, organizes workshops,
      and steers standards and the echo-IA Hub infrastructure.

      Steering and coordination are collaborative and transparent, with open meetings and
      shared decision-making. All participation is welcome — whether contributing data,
      tools, or feedback.
