      <p>
        <strong>echoIA</strong> (Enabling Cosmology with Homogenized Observations of Intrinsic Alignments)
        is a community effort to build a unified pipeline for <em>Intrinsic Alignment</em> (IA) analyses.
        Our first step is to gather publicly available <strong>galaxy shape catalogs</strong> in one place with
        clean links and minimal, comparable metadata—so researchers can quickly see what’s out there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going forward, we will also <strong>host or mirror catalogs on Zenodo</strong> under an echoIA collection
        (when licensing permits). Each entry will track provenance, version, license, and recommended citations, and
        will always link to the original source. When hosting isn’t allowed, we provide a clear link to the official release.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Curate:</strong> a community-maintained index of public catalogs</li>
        <li><strong>Host/Mirror:</strong> Zenodo deposits for stable access and DOIs (where allowed)</li>
        <li><strong>Standardize:</strong> comparable, high-level fields across releases</li>
        <li><strong>Credit:</strong> clear licensing & citation to original authors</li>
      </ul>
