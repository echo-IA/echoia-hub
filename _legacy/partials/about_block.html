      <p>
        <strong>echo-IA</strong> (Enabling Cosmology with Homogenized Observations of Intrinsic Alignments) is a community space
        for <em>intrinsic alignment</em> research. We bring together catalogs, tools, datasets, and workflows so results are easier
        to compare, reproduce, and extend.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goal is practical interoperability: lightweight standards, clear provenance, and shared building blocks—so teams can
        plug in their data or code and get to science faster. When licensing allows, we also <strong>host or mirror on Zenodo</strong>
        under an echo-IA collection, always linking back to original sources.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Catalogs:</strong> curated, public galaxy-shape catalogs with comparable metadata</li>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> analysis libraries, pipelines, diagnostics, and plotting utilities</li>
        <li><strong>Workflows:</strong> reproducible paths from inputs to posteriors (configs, CI, examples)</li>
        <li><strong>Standards:</strong> minimal schemas for fields, units, and metadata; recommended citations</li>
        <li><strong>Community:</strong> meetings, workshops, and issue trackers for coordination</li>
      </ul>
